# 🧑‍💼 My First Django Project — Employee Directory

This is my **first Django web application**, built to understand the **MVT (Model-View-Template)** pattern and how Django handles databases, templates, and URLs.  
It’s a simple **Employee Directory System** that displays employee details and shows how data flows in a Django project.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned about:
- Django **MVT architecture**
- How to create **models**, **views**, and **templates**
- Mapping **URLs** and handling **HTTP responses**
- Serving **static** and **media** files
- Using Django ORM for **database operations**
- Running **migrations** and managing data in `db.sqlite3`
